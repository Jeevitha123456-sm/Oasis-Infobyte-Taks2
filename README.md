# What is a Password Generator?
A password generator is a program that creates a random and unique password for a user. The password is typically generated based on a set of criteria, such as length, complexity, and character set.

# Explanation of Code
1. `generate_password` function: This function takes in four parameters: length, use_uppercase, use_numbers, and use_special_chars. It generates a random password based on these criteria.
2. `main` function: This function prompts the user to enter the password length and criteria (uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters). It then calls the generate_password function to generate a password based on the user's input.

# How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the desired password length.
3. Answer the prompts for using uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
4. The program will generate and display a random password based on your input.
